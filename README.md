============ Introduction ============
This small project is a test project to understand the ability of the developer to know-how of CSS styling and Drupal Themeing. 
The test project is developed as part of face website of OpenCharity and GeekLabel.

============ About Geek label ============ 
Geek label is a new design agency that requires a new website. In this test project I have used bootstrap framework as well as W3.CSS. I have tried to simplify bootstrap, in order to make the code simple and easy to understand. Unfortunately, I couldn't do few of the modules in this test-project, yet, I'm researching more on how to do the incomplete modules: e.g. carousel mobile/desktop animation and styling the google map. I hope you consider this test project as very near to the proposed design. I have also got AWS account and tried to upload the drupal website, though, I had some difficulty, so, I have uploaded the design to my domain http://supershrinivas.com/GeekLabel
